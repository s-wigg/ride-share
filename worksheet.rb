# Step 1: Establish the layers

  # Write a list of the layers here

# Overall database 
#   Driver ID Number
#       Info about each ride
#         date
#         Cost
#         rider id 
#         rating 

########################################################
# Step 2: Assign a data structure to each layer

  # Copy your list from above, and write what data structure each layer should have

# Overall database - hash 
  #   Driver ID Number - the keys in the overall hash 
        # Info about each ride - stored as an array, the value to the driver id keys 
        #   date - stored in hash 
        #   Cost - stored in hash 
        #   rider id - stored in hash 
        #   rating - stored in hash

# Step 3: Make the data structure!

    # Setup the data strcture and manually write in data presented in rides.csv
